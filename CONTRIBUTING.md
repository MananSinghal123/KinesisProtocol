# Welcome to HyperHarvest Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to HyperHarvest!

This guide provides an overview of our contribution workflow to ensure an effective process for everyone involved.

## About the Project

HyperHarvest is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform focused on cross-chain yield farming. Our goal is to provide users with a seamless experience for managing their assets across various chains, leveraging protocols like AAVE and Chainlink CCIP.

Read the [README](README.md) for a detailed HyperHarvest overview.

### Vision

HyperHarvest aims to streamline cross-chain yield farming and asset management. Our project focuses on integrating DeFi protocols with a user-friendly interface, ensuring that users can efficiently manage their assets across Arbitrum, Optimism, and other networks.

### Project Status

HyperHarvest is actively under development. You can view open issues, follow the development process, and contribute to the project.

## Getting Started

You can contribute to HyperHarvest in several ways:

- Address open issues
- Open new issues
- Report bugs or request new features
- Enhance the documentation

Contributions are made via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). Here are a few general guidelines:

- Check existing Issues and PRs before creating new ones.
- Contributions should focus on addressing the functionality of an issue or style improvements, but not both simultaneously.
- If encountering an error, provide context, including what you were trying to do and how to reproduce it.
- Follow the formatting in the code repository. Configure your IDE with the prettier/linting config files included in the project.
- Update the README.md file to reflect any relevant changes.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems, request features, or discuss potential changes before creating a PR.

#### Solve an Issue

Browse our [existing issues](https://github.com/ETHarvest/HyperHarvest/issues) to find one that interests you.

If an issue is being worked on, it will be assigned to a contributor. If you find an issue to work on, you can assign it to yourself and open a PR with your solution.

#### Create a New Issue

If you donâ€™t find a related issue, you can open a new one.

When creating a new issue:

- Provide as much context as possible.
- Include steps to reproduce the issue or reasons for the feature request.
- Attach screenshots or videos if available.

### Pull Requests

#### Pull Request Process

We use the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr):

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the project to your local machine
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name
4. Commit your changes to the new branch
5. Push changes to your fork
6. Open a PR in our repository and tag one of the maintainers for review

Tips for a high-quality pull request:

- Title the PR accurately to reflect the work done.
- Structure the description with bullet points and include screenshots if needed.
- Link to the issue if applicable.
- Use a concise commit message summarizing the changes made.

Once your PR is submitted:

- We may ask for clarifications, additional information, or modifications before merging. These requests aim to ensure clarity and streamline the process.
- Resolve conversations as you update your PR.
